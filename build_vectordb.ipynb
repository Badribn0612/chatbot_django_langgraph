The search results display, and the matching results show how many times the term is mentioned. A link to each of the topics containing the search term displays. To return to the search results after clicking on a link to one of the topics, click your browser\\'s back button. Multiple Word Search Use quotes around multiple word search terms (for example, â€œdata sourceâ€ ) to view the topics that contain an exact phrase. When a topic is opened from the search results page, the search terms are highlighted . Users can remove highlighting by clicking the Remove Highlights button on the topic toolbar located above the topic title. Search within a Topic Use Ctrl+F to search in the current topic. Case Insensitive Search terms are not case sensitive and include matches with variant endings. For example, a search for \"Sync Map with Target Design\" returns \"Syncing Map with Target Design\" and \"Synced Map with Target Design.\" Boolean Operators The following Boolean operators are also allowed: AND OR () NOTE: Use parentheses to combine search terms with Boolean operators. For example, search for Events and (validations or rules) to return a list of topics containing the terms events and either the terms validations or rules. ^ NOTE: Use the carat symbol (^) for NOT expressions. Enter (^) between terms to search for topics containing one term but not the other. For example, to search for topics that contain Org Units but not positions, enter \"Org Units\" ^ Positions. The word NOT cannot be used as part of an expression when searching, only the ^ is allowed. NOTE: Wildcard searches are not allowed. Filter by Component Click the Filter button and select a component from the drop-down to limit the search to a specific component. Searching All Files allows a full text search of the online help across all components and solutions. Was this article helpful? Yes No Sorry about that. Want to tell us more?

An application suite of the Stewardship Tier is Advanced Data Migration (ADM). Console Console is the single point for the management and administration for Advanced Data Migration (ADM).. Target Design Design is a component of Advanced Data Migration (ADM) used to document tables, fields and sources used in migration projects. Targets can be imported from a database, System Type, or Excel file. In Target Design, users can configure rules for target fields and lookup tables for value mapping and create field groups and metric groups to categorize and prioritize data as it is mapped. Map Map is a strategic component of Advanced Data Migration (ADM) used in the Mapping phase of a data migration project. The tool facilitates the process of mapping for a target system implementation. Since the mapping process can change at various times during the implementation, Map is a key component for capturing and tracking requirements, customer decisions and specifications to provide accurate mapping information. Construct Construct is the component ofAdvanced Data Migration (ADM) used in the Data Construction phase of a data migration project. The tool assists in the creating and converting data to load into the target system. Transform Transform is a component of Advanced Data Migration (ADM) that provides measurable advantages in the Data Preparation phase of a data migration project. The tool cleans, manipulates and reports on data, and it exports the data so that they can be loaded into a target system using a load tool. SQL AutoGen SQL AutoGen is a component of Advanced Data Migration (ADM) that creates basic objects used by the migration process (tables, rules and reports) so that users can focus on addressing complex requirements. Data Services AutoGen Data Services AutoGen is a component of Advanced Data Migration (ADM) that provides the ability to generate Data Services Jobs that perform target enrichments and validations, including post load validation of the data loaded into the target application. Using the AutoGen request options in the Stewardship Tier, users send the metadata required to generate the Data Services Jobs for the specific target to the Knowledge Platform for processing. Data Services Jobs are created based on rules configured in Target Design. Once generated, the jobs are registered in Transform as Data Services rules. Was this article helpful?
